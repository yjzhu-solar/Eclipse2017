This respository stores Jupyter notebooks and IDL codes to analyze spectroscopic observations of the solar corona during the 2017 total solar eclipse (TSE). The observation was obtained by a three-channel PArtially Multiplexed Imaging Spectrometer (3PAMIS). Many thanks to Prof. Shadia Habbal, Prof. Adalbert Ding, Dr. Michael Nassir, and their team for developing the instrument, organized the expedition, making the observations, and sharing the data. Special gratitudes to Bryan Yamashiro for helping me on data reduction and calibration. 3PAMIS observations were compared to EIS and CoMP observations, and the results are summarized in a manuscript submitted to ApJ. 

Some Jupyter notebooks use [my naive Python scripts](https://github.com/yjzhu-solar/MyPy). The HTML exports of the Jupyter notebooks are available in the ipynb\_html directory.
